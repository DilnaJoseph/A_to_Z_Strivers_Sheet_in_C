/*
Problem Statement: Given an array of N integers, left rotate the array by one place.

Example 1:
Input: N = 5, array[] = {1,2,3,4,5}
Output: 2,3,4,5,1
Explanation: 
Since all the elements in array will be shifted toward left by one so ‘2’ will now become the 
first index and and ‘1’ which was present at first index will be shifted at last.
*/

// Method 1: create a dummy array; dummy_arr[i]=arr[i+1];
// Method 2: store arr[0] in a variable; arr[i+1]=arr[i]

void solve(int arr[], int n) {

    int temp = arr[0]; // store the first element

    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        arr[i] = arr[i + 1]; // shift left
    }

    arr[n - 1] = temp; // put first element at the end
    
    printf("\n");
}
