/*
Problem Statement: Given an array of size n, write a program to check if the given array is sorted in (ascending / Increasing / Non-decreasing) order or not. 
If the array is sorted then return True, Else return False.

Note: Two consecutive equal values are considered to be sorted.

Example 1:
   Input: N = 5, array[] = {1,2,3,4,5}
   Output: True.
   Explanation: The given array is sorted i.e Every element in the array is smaller than or equals to its next values, So the answer is True.
