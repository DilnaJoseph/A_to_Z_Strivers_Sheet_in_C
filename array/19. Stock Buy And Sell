/*
You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock. 
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and 
sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.

Note: That buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 
is not allowed because you must buy before 
you sell.
