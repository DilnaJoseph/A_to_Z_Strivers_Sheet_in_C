/*
Problem Statement: You are given an array of integers, your task is to move all the zeros in the array to the end of the array and move non-negative integers to the front by maintaining their order.

Examples

Example 1:
Input: 1 ,0 ,2 ,3 ,0 ,4 ,0 ,1
Output: 1 ,2 ,3 ,4 ,1 ,0 ,0 ,0
Explanation: All the zeros are moved to the end and non-negative integers are moved to front by maintaining order

//Method: using two pointers
void moveZeroes(int* arr, int n) {

    if(n<2){return;}
    
    int i=0;
    for(int j=1;j<n;j++){
        if(arr[i]==0&&arr[j]!=0){
            int temp=arr[i];
            arr[i++]=arr[j];
            arr[j]=temp;
        }
        if(arr[i]!=0){
            i++;
